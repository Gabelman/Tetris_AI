## Tetris AI Project
### Run the Code
Requirements can be installed using
```pip install -r requirements.txt```.\
The required python version is: python3.11, as some functionalities of OpenAI's gymnasium don't work on python3.12 (specifically the visualization of the game).\
If another python version is available, the following packages are required:
```
gymnasium[atari]
torch
numpy
tqdm
wandb
pygame
```
